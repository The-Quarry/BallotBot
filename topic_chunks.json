These policies have discouraged large-scale housing projects by making them less profitable for developers.\n\n3. **Construction Capacity**: The candidate acknowledges the physical limitations of the local construction industry, suggesting that the current capacity cannot meet housing demands without importing labor and construction companies, which presents additional challenges.\n\n4. **Housing Committee Support**: The candidate supports the creation of a dedicated housing committee to address the complexities of housing and immigration issues, emphasizing the need for detailed evaluation and strategic planning.\n\n5. **Licensing and Social Housing**: The candidate raises concerns about the issuance of long-term licenses that allow incoming workers to bring extended families, potentially increasing demand for social housing and affecting local families' access to these resources.",
